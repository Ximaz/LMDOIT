# LMDOIT (Let Me DOwnload IT)

**L**et **M**e **DO**wnload **IT** is a project which lets you schemafy your download process.

You'll be able to use plenty of methods for :
-   authentication (cookie, username:password, bearer token, ...),
-   parsing response (HTML Parser, regex, JSON server response, ...),
-   pass custom headers to certain routes,
-   add debugging steps by downloading response into files that you can freely open,
-   add custom starting points (instead of re-doing all requests, use a downloaded file as starting point)
